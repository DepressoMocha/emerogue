# CHANGELOG

No actual versioning, as I am not sure if I want to do it and possibly fuck up my save in the future.

8/10/2024:
- Pokeblock can now be scattered by directly interacting on the Honey Tree
- Press R to fly instead of B, now you can only cycle with L
- Talk to your mon to ride it, press B to dismount. Need basic whistle. You can cycle through your party with it as well. It does not change the order of the mon on your party, and you still need the golden whistle if you want to access your daycare mons.
- You can now change your mon's pokeball via an NPC in the town square after buying the school upgrade (might change in the future?)
